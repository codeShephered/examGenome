##Prompt:
Generate 110 unambiguous, unbiased, and verifiable questions about 'Column method multiplication, addition & subtraction' in Mathematics at a easy, medium difficulty level in English.
        Cover a wide range of subtopics within the specialization, including both theoretical concepts and practical real-world applications.
        The questions should reflect the variety of topics that may appear in competitive examinations and educational assessments.

        Ensure that each question is based on factual information that can be verified using reliable sources such as textbooks, academic papers, or well-known websites (e.g., government or university websites). Avoid speculative or opinion-based content.

        All questions must be unambiguous, with clear language that leaves no room for misinterpretation.

        The questions can be phrased with rules on 'Column method multiplication, addition & subtraction' in Mathematics , formula for 'Column method multiplication, addition & subtraction', tips and tricks on long division etc., if multiple varieties of questions are to be framed without repetition.

        Provide detailed background material that would help a student understand the following question.The material should cover fundamental concepts, definitions, and any necessary background knowledge related to the question.

        Each question MUST be unique, and have a correct answer, and a detailed explanation or steps on how to arrive on the correct answer. Format each question as follows:

        question: [Question text]
        answer: [Correct answer]
        details: [Explanation]

        Ensure that the options are plausible, and avoid trivial or obviously incorrect answers. Include real-world context where relevant, and ensure that all questions are diverse, covering different aspects of 'Column method multiplication, addition & subtraction' in Mathematics. Provide questions that are contextualized and solvable using the arithmetic and reasoning skills of children aged 11 or less. Create the output in JSON format.
