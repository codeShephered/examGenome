Question: Which of the following is not a mixed number: 0 1/2, 3 4/5, 7 0/3, 2 1/1?
Status: Error
Explanation: The definition of a mixed number (from Q3) is "A number that has a whole number part and a proper fraction part."
- 0 1/2 has a whole number part (0) and a proper fraction part (1/2). So, it IS a mixed number.
- 3 4/5 has a whole number part (3) and a proper fraction part (4/5). So, it IS a mixed number.
- 7 0/3 has a whole number part (7) and a proper fraction part (0/3, as 0 < 3). So, it IS a mixed number.
- 2 1/1 has a whole number part (2) but its fraction part (1/1) is an improper fraction (numerator equals denominator), not a proper one. Therefore, 2 1/1 is NOT a mixed number according to the given definition.
The provided answer "0 1/2" is incorrect; "2 1/1" is the correct answer.

Question: Which of the following is not a valid mixed number: 2 3/4, 0 5/6, 7 1/2, 10 7/8?
Status: Error
Explanation: The definition of a mixed number (from Q3) is "A number that has a whole number part and a proper fraction part."
- 2 3/4, 7 1/2, and 10 7/8 all fit this definition.
- 0 5/6 has a whole number part (0) and a proper fraction part (5/6). Therefore, according to the definition, it IS a valid mixed number.
Given the established definition in Q3, all listed options are structurally valid mixed numbers. The question might implicitly assume a stricter convention (e.g., whole number part must be greater than zero) or implies something not typically written as a mixed number, but based strictly on the provided definition, 0 5/6 is valid.

Question: Can the denominator of a proper fraction be 1?
Status: Error
Explanation: A proper fraction is defined as "A fraction where the numerator is less than the denominator." If the denominator is 1, then for it to be a proper fraction, the numerator must be less than 1. The only whole number (non-negative integer) that satisfies this condition is 0. So, 0/1 is a proper fraction (as 0 < 1). This is consistent with the answer to Q42, "Is 0/5 a proper fraction?" which is "Yes". Therefore, a proper fraction *can* have a denominator of 1 (e.g., 0/1). The answer "No" is incorrect.
