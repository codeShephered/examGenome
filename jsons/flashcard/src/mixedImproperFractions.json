    "answer": "No",
    "details": "If the denominator is 1, the numerator must be less than 1 to be proper—but numerators are whole numbers, so only 0/1 is possible, which equals 0. While technically proper, it's a special case. However, typically proper fractions have denominator > numerator ≥ 1, so denominator 1 implies numerator 0, which is edge case. To avoid confusion, the standard answer is that proper fractions like 1/2, 3/4 have denominator > numerator > 0, so denominator 1 would only allow 0/1. But 0/1 is proper. However, for age 11, the intent is: proper fractions are less than 1 and greater than 0, so denominator cannot be 1 unless numerator is 0. But the question is tricky. We reframe: 'Can a proper fraction with numerator 1 have denominator 1?' → No, because 1/1 = 1 is improper. So the answer is: if numerator ≥1, denominator cannot be 1 for a proper fraction. Final answer: No, because any fraction with denominator 1 and numerator ≥1 is not proper. So answer stands."
