    "question": "If a worker can paint a wall in 6 hours, what fraction of the wall can they paint in 1 hour?",
    "answer": "1/6",
    "details": "The rate of work is defined as the portion of a task completed per unit time. If one whole wall is painted in 6 hours, then in 1 hour, the worker completes 1 ÷ 6 = 1/6 of the wall. This is a standard application of the formula: Rate = Work ÷ Time."

    "question": "Two machines can produce 100 widgets together in 2 hours. If one machine works alone and produces 30 widgets in 2 hours, how many widgets does the other machine produce in 2 hours?",
    "answer": "70",
    "details": "Together, the machines produce 100 widgets in 2 hours. If Machine A produces 30 widgets in that time, then Machine B must produce the remainder: 100 − 30 = 70 widgets. This uses the principle that combined work equals the sum of individual contributions over the same time period."
